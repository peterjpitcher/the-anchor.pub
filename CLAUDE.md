# CLAUDE.md — The Anchor Pub Website

Project-specific guidance. The workspace CLAUDE.md at `/Users/peterpitcher/Cursor/CLAUDE.md` covers general standards (TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase, Git, testing, auth). Read this file for what's unique to this project.

## ⚠ Before writing any customer-facing content — read the SSOT

**Mandatory pre-flight for any task that produces customer-facing content** (page copy, JSON-LD schemas, blog posts, social copy, marketing emails, email templates, press copy, alt text, meta descriptions, etc.):

1. Read **`docs/SSOT.md`** — the single source of truth for every brand and operational fact.
2. For structured lookups (menu prices, drinks inventory, hours), `SSOT.json` mirrors a subset of the SSOT in JSON.
3. **The SSOT wins.** If existing page copy disagrees with the SSOT, the page is wrong — not the SSOT. Fix the page.
4. **Do not invent facts.** If a claim you want to make is not in the SSOT, stop and ask. Do not infer, do not embellish, do not fall back on training data.
5. **When operational reality changes, update `docs/SSOT.md` first.** Page copy, JSON-LD, and the management DB all follow.

`docs/SSOT.md` covers: identity & voice · contact & location · opening hours · Sunday roast · weekday food · drinks · booking & deposits · venue/parking/amenities · beer garden · events · private hire · ratings · areas served · banned claims.

## Stack

- **Next.js 14** App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, CVA
- **No database** — this is a marketing/booking website only; all data lives in the management app
- **Hosting:** Vercel | **DNS:** Cloudflare | **Analytics:** Google Tag Manager
- **Tests:** Jest (`npm test`) in `tests/`

## Relationship with OJ-AnchorManagementTools

These two applications form a paired system. Understanding their relationship is essential before making changes to anything involving bookings, hours, or availability.

### What each app does

| | The Anchor Website (`OJ-The-Anchor.pub`) | Management App (`OJ-AnchorManagementTools`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Customer-facing marketing site + booking flow | Staff/admin tool for managing the pub |
| **Users** | Public customers | Staff and managers |
| **Database** | None | Supabase (PostgreSQL) — sole source of truth |
| **Hosting** | Vercel (this repo) | Vercel (separate repo at `/Users/peterpitcher/Cursor/OJ-AnchorManagementTools`) |

### Data flow

```
Management App (Supabase DB)
        │
        │  REST API (ANCHOR_API_KEY auth)
        │  Base URL: management.orangejelly.co.uk
        ▼
  Website (this repo)
  Next.js API routes proxy the calls
  (protects API key, handles CORS, adds caching)
```

The website **never writes to any database directly**. All mutations (create booking, submit enquiry, etc.) go through the management API.

### Key API endpoints the website consumes

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /business/hours` | Regular opening hours + special hours overrides |
| `GET /table-bookings/availability` | Available booking slots for a given date/type |
| `POST /table-bookings` | Create a table booking |
| `GET /events` | Upcoming events |
| `GET /menus` | Food/drink menus |

### Special hours override pattern

The management app stores per-date overrides in a `special_hours` table. The website receives these via `/business/hours`. Critical fields:

- `kitchen: null` — kitchen is closed for that date
- `is_kitchen_closed: true` — explicit kitchen closure flag (defence-in-depth)
- `is_closed: true` — full venue closure
- `schedule_config: []` — custom booking schedule for the date

**Important:** `kitchen: null` must be treated as a deliberate "closed" signal — not as "data absent". Use `??` not `||` when resolving special vs regular kitchen data. Using `||` will cause `null` to fall through to regular hours. This has bitten us before (March 2026 bug).

### Booking type → kitchen dependency

| Booking type | Requires kitchen |
|---|---|
| `sunday_lunch` | Yes |
| `food` | Yes |
| `drinks` | No |

If `is_kitchen_closed` or `kitchen === null` for a date, food/sunday_lunch slots must return empty. Drinks slots are unaffected.

### Key files in this repo that touch the management API

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `lib/api.ts` | Main API client — `anchorAPI.*` methods. Also contains `buildTableAvailabilityFromBusinessHours()` (fallback slot generator) |
| `lib/table-booking-service-windows.ts` | `resolveServiceRanges()` — converts business hours into bookable time slots |
| `lib/hours-utils.ts` | `getEffectiveDayHours()`, `isKitchenClosed()` — correct `??`-based utilities for hours logic |
| `app/api/*/route.ts` | API proxy routes — never expose `ANCHOR_API_KEY` client-side |

## Critical Business Rules

These are short reminders. The full set of operational claims and banned phrases lives in **`docs/SSOT.md`** — read it before writing any content.

- **Brand:** Always "The Anchor" (not "The Anchor Pub") in customer-facing copy.
- **Contact:** manager@the-anchor.pub | 01753 682707.
- **Location:** Stanwell Moor, near Heathrow Airport.
- **Monday kitchen:** Always closed unless a special-hours record explicitly opens it.
- **Sunday lunch:** Walk-ins welcome 1pm – 6pm. **No pre-order, no Saturday cutoff, no per-roast prepayment** (changed at the 17 May 2026 walk-in launch). Blocked only if the kitchen is closed for that date.
- **Sunday roast menu (current):** Beef Topside £22 · Pork Leg £20 · Turkey w/ Stuffing Ball £19 · Beef & Ale Pie £21 · Chicken & Wild Mushroom Pie £21 · Vegan Wellington £20 · Kids Roast £14. Wellington is **vegan**, never "vegetarian". See `docs/SSOT.md` §4 for full rules (gravy, accompaniments, retired items).
- **Group deposit:** Groups of 10+ on any day, any booking type — £10 per person, deducted from the bill.
- **No service:** No breakfast, no delivery, no Sky/TNT Sports, no guest ales, no real-ale positioning, no wedding receptions, no accessible toilet, no baby changing.
- **Verified copy:** `docs/SSOT.md` is canonical. `SSOT.json` mirrors the structured subset.

## SEO & Domain

- **Canonical domain:** `https://www.the-anchor.pub` (with www — Cloudflare + Vercel)
- **Cloudflare TLS:** Must be "Full" or "Full (strict)" — never "Flexible" (causes redirect loops)

### Canonical URL pattern — DO NOT hardcode in root layout

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx — metadataBase only, NO alternates.canonical here
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  metadataBase: new URL('https://www.the-anchor.pub'),
}

// Individual pages — relative canonical
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  alternates: { canonical: './' },
}
```

Hardcoding `canonical` in the root layout makes every page claim to be the homepage. This was a past bug — don't repeat it.

## Architecture

```
app/                  Next.js App Router pages
  api/                Proxy routes to management API
  book-table/         Booking wizard flow
components/
  ui/                 Reusable primitives (Button, Input, Badge, etc.)
  features/           Business-domain components
  tracking/           GTM analytics components
lib/
  api.ts              Management API client + availability logic
  table-booking-service-windows.ts  Slot resolution
  hours-utils.ts      Business hours utilities
  gtm-events.ts       Analytics event helpers
  constants.ts        Business constants
public/               Static assets
docs/                 Documentation (SSOT.md ← canonical brand/claims source, api-integration.md, parking-api.md)
tests/                Jest test files
```

### Patterns

- **Default to Server Components.** Add `'use client'` only for interactivity.
- **API proxy pattern:** All calls to `management.orangejelly.co.uk` go through `app/api/*/route.ts`. Never call the management API directly from client components.
- **Hours single source of truth:** Use `lib/hours-utils.ts` utilities for any hours display logic. Do not re-implement hours parsing inline.
- **CVA for component variants** — use `cva()`, not ad-hoc Tailwind conditionals.

## Adding a New Page

```typescript
// app/new-route/page.tsx
import { Metadata } from 'next'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Page Title | The Anchor Stanwell Moor',
  description: 'Page description',
  alternates: { canonical: './' },
}

export default function Page() {
  return <>{/* content */}</>
}
```

Also add the route to `app/sitemap.ts`.

---

## Analytics

```typescript
'use client'
import { trackEventName } from '@/lib/gtm-events'

<Button onClick={() => trackEventName('source_location')}>Action</Button>
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ANCHOR_API_KEY` | Auth key for management.orangejelly.co.uk |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID` | Google Tag Manager container ID |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_AVIATIONSTACK_API_KEY` | Flight data (Heathrow parking feature) |
