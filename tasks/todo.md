# Workspace standards, security and context work, 4 to 5 September 2026

Owner decisions on the record: unlink the never-used marketing skills; standardise CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md across every project; fix everything found, excluding the Barons projects.

## Done, 4 September
- [x] Slimmed the CLAUDE.md chain, path-scoped the Supabase rule, moved on-demand rules to .claude/docs
- [x] Codex parity: AGENTS.md symlinks, global contract symlink, project_doc_fallback_filenames
- [x] Audited 209 conversations, 1,379 commits across 18 repos, and every skill
- [x] Parked 26 unused skills, reinstalled brainstorming, writing-plans and systematic-debugging
- [x] Added the no-em-dash Bash hook, closing the shell-write gap
- [x] Hardened six public write paths on this site to fail closed
- [x] Pinned the business timezone with a UTC counter-run in seven repos
- [x] Anon-access allowlists with drift tests in eight repos

## Done, 5 September
- [x] Applied to production: profiles read closed (management app); rate-limit function and analytics policies closed, secret-table grants removed (CheersAI); orphan booking function dropped (CashBingo); trigger functions closed (Planner 2.0, OrangeJelly); table grants narrowed (Dukes Head)
- [x] Root cause fixed: default privileges no longer grant anon on new objects, in six databases
- [x] Corrected my own regression: revoking EXECUTE on two RLS predicate helpers made anon queries error instead of returning no rows. Restored and verified by querying as the anon role
- [x] Repo and database migration histories reconciled, so supabase db push will not re-apply
- [x] Em dashes removed from the AI prompts and stripped from generated social copy (CheersAI)
- [x] QuizNight stopped gitignoring its own instruction files
- [x] All 18 repos now have a tracked CLAUDE.md and an AGENTS.md symlink

## Deliberately not done
- Barons projects untouched, as instructed. The BaronsHub migration drafted on 4 September is still unapplied: three SECURITY DEFINER functions there are callable by anyone with the publishable key.
- QuizNight session_state is readable by any anon key by design, because the TV display carries the token in the URL where a policy cannot see it. It holds no question or answer text today.
- Supabase's own platform default still grants anon on objects created by supabase_admin. It cannot be changed without membership of that role.
- OJ-Planner looks superseded by OJ-PlanneriPhoneApp. Its instruction file says to check before investing.

# Terrestrial rugby bookings

- [x] Record the owner decision and preserve live hours rules.
- [x] Accept approved booking windows in the feed consumer and booking checks.
- [x] Explain start and closing limits accurately on cards, booking forms and calendars.
- [x] Verify focused browser flow and full London/UTC gates.

Website consumer change is independently deployable before the Cheers producer. No database change.

Validation: lint, types, build, 183 suites and 1979 passing tests in both London and UTC after merging the API-outage changes from main. Isolated owner-approved browser booking, cancellation and response recovery passed with no external writes, console errors or accessibility violations.

## API connections, 5 September 2026

- [x] Complete parking and runtime API fallback remediation. Evidence and checks: tasks/fix-function/2026-09-05-api-connections/. Verified branch changes; root coordinates merge and deployment.

## 5 September 2026: Anchor booking growth

- [x] Add short private-hire enquiry, page-specific booking actions, Sunday copy, Christmas course selection and durable event requests.
- [x] Prevent active enquiry promotion interruptions and redact analytics URL context.
- [x] Reproduce and fix quick-book failure loading; verify the full-form purpose handoff.
- [x] Finish browser evidence and final gates after the latest source changes.
- [x] Release after exact owner approval and management migration verification. Website commit `443959e552029a30ba391f46ccf28eb58491a86f` is live as `dpl_G6x2MEyHZ7rx88zSp8bDyqJ8CR7y`; the production alias, short enquiry, event request controls and Christmas course journey were checked. No real customer submission was made.

Full evidence and exact production approval package are in the paired management repository at `tasks/anchor-booking-growth/`.

## 5 September 2026: Conditional late rugby viewing

Complexity 4, website consumer release coordinated with a separate Cheers producer release. The optional feed field permits either release order without changing admission hours.

- [x] Record the owner policy in SSOT before customer copy.
- [x] Consume the optional policy in cards, booking summaries and calendars.
- [x] Update editorial and verify unchanged opening, kitchen and arrival limits.
- [x] Run focused browser checks, London/UTC tests, lint, types and build.
- [ ] Release and verify the exact production deployment.

Validation: 190 suites, 2056 passed and 1 skipped in both zones; 53 final focused checks in each zone after copy review. Final lint, types and production build passed. Isolated browser verified conditional card, booking summary, Find a table and calendar with zero booking writes and no browser errors. Deployment evidence is maintained outside the repository.


# Event booking quantities, 6 September 2026

- [x] Trace the website form and both API validation paths.
- [x] Remove per-guest name collection for all event ticket types.
- [x] Verify quantity-only bookings, failures, lint, types and build.

Scope: website only, lead booker details retained. Management API already accepts omitted names. No migration. Local only until deployment approval.

Verification: Node 20 lint, standalone typecheck, all 191 test suites (2,083 passed, one skipped) and production build passed. Combined form/API suite has 26 passing tests in UTC. Browser verification passed with the actual component in an isolated Next app: four prepaid seats and mixed quantities of two Adult plus one Child submitted only lead details and quantities. Intercepted 503 responses showed Booking not completed and the phone fallback. Screenshots: output/playwright/event-booking-quantity/. No live bookings, messages or payments. The production event page wrapper and real payment flow were not exercised. Local only, deployment awaits approval.

Files changed: components/features/EventBooking/ManagementEventBookingForm.tsx, app/api/event-bookings/route.ts, their two existing test files and tasks/todo.md. Deliberately unchanged: management application, database, staff booking forms, historical attendee-name records, shared legacy name helpers, payment processing and event page wrapper. Supplied legacy names remain supported.

Owner approved website production deployment on 6 September 2026. All five changed files belong to this approved change.

Owner added removal of the food discussion question during the approved deployment. Removed that question, food payload fields and related confirmation copy. Early-arrival request retained. Form and its tests are the only additional application files changed.

Food-question follow-up verified: Node 20 full lint, typecheck, 191 suites (2,083 passed, one skipped) and production build passed. No migration or management changes.
