/**
 * The availability contract fixture must stay byte-identical in both repos.
 *
 * AMS produces the availability answer and this site consumes it. Both test
 * suites assert against a copy of the same fixture, which is only meaningful
 * while the two copies ARE the same file. Nothing enforced that: either side
 * could edit its own copy, watch its own tests go green, and ship a contract the
 * other end had never agreed to.
 *
 * A shared CI job is not available, because the repos do not build together. So
 * each repo pins the digest instead. Editing the fixture in one repo fails that
 * repo's own tests until the digest is updated, and updating the digest is the
 * moment you are reminded to copy the file across.
 *
 * TO CHANGE THE CONTRACT, do all three in the same change:
 *   1. Edit the fixture here and copy it to the AMS repo at
 *      src/app/api/table-bookings/__tests__/fixtures/table-availability-contract.json
 *      (byte for byte).
 *   2. Recompute:  shasum -a 256 <fixture>
 *   3. Update EXPECTED_CONTRACT_SHA256 in this file AND in the AMS repo's
 *      matching test.
